# Homebrew - FITS alternate

A homebrew tap to provide a formula for a previous version of [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits) (The File Information Tool Set).

This is needed in order to avoid an issue with the current version of the tool set that causes an [issue](https://github.com/harvard-lts/fits/issues/140) with applications based on the [Samvera](https://projecthydra.org/) framework.

This formula is nearly identical to the official [fits formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/fits.rb), aside from the version installed, natch.
